## Challenge  
*Which challenge have you decided to compete for?*: 

Update Possible Challenge - Over-The-Air (OTA) updates

## Core Idea  
*What is your rough solution idea?*

*Sketch something that helps understand e.g. mermaid chart*

**The Problem**: This challenge addresses real-world regulations for OTA update processes for commercial and industrial fleets. Starter templates, simulated agents, and reference microservices (uServices) accelerate development.
Besides that every driver is unique, but vehicles come with generic "one-size-fits-all" settings. Regulations like UN R155/R156 demand secure, traceable, and auditable updates, but current OTA solutions lack personalization.

**Our Innovation**: Is the possibility to continuously optimizes vehicle behavior through intelligent, regulation-compliant OTA updates. Your car becomes truly *yours*.

# 2. How Do You Work

## Development Process  
*Brief overview of your development process.*

We started by brainstorming to create a case study, which allowed us to define different areas of work, assigned to each element of the group. Each element will create the sub-issues to be able to fulfill the required work.
We will review the status of the development, at specific times during the event.

### Planning & Tracking  
*How do you plan and track progress?*

Using miro and github projects board to track issues.

### Quality Assurance  
*How do you ensure quality (e.g., testing, documentation, code reviews)?*

To ensure quality, we will use code reviews:
    - we will enforce that a pull request as to be approved by one member of the group before merging.

## Communication  
*How does your team communicate?*

As a tool for planing and task management we use miro and Github projects, most of our communication is in person, and throught a slack group. We will follow the open source standard for software development, using issues, issue related branches and pull requests.

## Decision Making  
*How are decisions made in your team?*

We started by defining the requirements, and the case study, then we defined generally the required tasks and their dependecies. This allowed to define the areas of work of each element of the group, and now we will decompose these general tasks into smaller ones, to fill in the github project board. Updates of decisions will be done, on small meetings every 2-3 hours.
